		<h2>Get to know me</h2>
		<p>My name is Bryan Mwalwala and I'm a skilled business consultant, with a technical background. I love creating anew & bringing sustainable change to our society in the process. I believe in failing fast and learning from my mistakes. Moving fast and breaking things is my driving philosophy. I love the simpler things in life; being a minimalist i value what really matters. I am mostly with my family and my dogs and there is nowhere else i would rather be. Lately, i have been obsessed with this game called really bad chess ( the chess pieces appear at random! It's so challenging and thus i enjoy it. ) I am fluent in English, Kiswahili and French.</p>

				<h2>Training in Html, Css & Android in 2018 at Emobilis Technology Institute for 3 months</h2>
				<p>I underwent training in creating responsive websites, and a brief training making android applications. My final project was a clone app that was able to have the same exact functioning that Uber does, enabling one to hail a cab and get connected to a driver. I was thereafter able to get a certificate that kickstarted my journey in tech.</p>

				<h2>Applied Computer Technology undergraduate @USIU</h2>
				<p>I thereafter enrolled into the Applied Computer Technology programme at USIU, learning C, and learning french and philosophy which gave me a rounded life perspective. I also made lifelong friendships and collaborated with my peers, it being my first experience working in a team and assuming a leadership role.</p>

				<h2>Google digital skills for Africa training</h2>
				<p>I did a SEO and SEM course on Google digital skills for Africa, getting a certificate. I, therefore, understand how to use certain keywords to enable crawlers to easily pick up what you offer and leading to customers searching for your offering to easily find you.</p>

			<div class="Power Learn project">
				<img src="plp.jpeg" alt="Power learn project">
				<h2>Power learn project</h2>
				<p>I am part of the February 2025 Power learn project cohort, learning to make responsive websites with Html & Css, creating Python applications & database design using SQL. I shall also do a specialisation in creating Ai models, being part of a rapidly growing and changing industry. At the end of the program I shall create a final project that aims to offer a technological solution that aligns with one of the sustainable development goals. </p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div class="experience">
			<div class="Zist Shopping">
				<img src="zist.jpg" alt="Zist">
				<h2>My on-demand delivery startup, Zist Shopping.</h2>
				<p>One afternoon when my mother sent me to the shop, I wondered aloud whether this would be something that would change in the future, whether we would have robots who would bring us our every need right to our doorstep. From then till now, it has been my life's work to create the future of e-commerce. That is what we're doing at Zist. I have been working on this since 2020, and having released a fully-functioning end to end MVP, i am now working towards reiterating and leveraging Ai to elevate the vision i always carry with me.</p>

				<h2>Mug palace, custom made mugs</h2>
				<p>My best friends and i bought a mug press and we began selling custom mugs and even water bottles on Instagram. I use mugs made by my own hand and that's the coolest fun fact about me. This was a pet project that was near and dear to my heart and one that brought us a whole lot closer.</p>

			<div class="USIU Connect">
				<img src="usiuconnect.jpg" alt="UC">
				<h2>Usiu Connect</h2>
				<p>While at Usiu, i came up with the idea to release a social networking app for the campus just like Mark Zuckerberg did at Harvard. I was able to collaborate with my peers and build a prototype but we learnt that our product didn't really fit with the users, we hadn't built something people would want. We therefore pivoted into the zing messaging service.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Zing">
				<img src="zing.jpg" alt="Zing messaging app">
				<h2>Zing messaging app</h2>
				<p>Zing is the first instant messaging app focused on Kenya. Built for Kenya by Kenyans. With the ability to make calls, send messages and even add friends, it enables you to stay connected with the people who matter most to you. We aim to keep adding new features that will make it competitive with messaging platforms such as Whatsapp and Signal.</p>
